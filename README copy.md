5. Add Integration Tests:

`integration_test/app_test.dart`:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:integration_test/integration_test.dart';
import 'package:mobile/main.dart';

void main() {
  IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  group('end-to-end test', () {
    testWidgets('verify map loading and marker display',
        (WidgetTester tester) async {
      await tester.pumpWidget(const MyApp());
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();

      // Verify map is displayed
      expect(find.byType(MapboxMap), findsOneWidget);

      // Test marker addition
      await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.refresh));
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();

      // Verify offline functionality
      await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.download));
      await tester.pumpAndSettle();
    });
  });
}

Add Performance Monitoring:

lib/core/performance/performance_monitor.dart:
dartCopyimport 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:flutter/rendering.dart';

class PerformanceMonitor {
  static void startMonitoring() {
    if (kDebugMode) {
      debugPrintRebuildDirtyWidgets = true;
      debugPrintLayouts = true;
      debugPrintBeginFrameBanner = true;
      debugPrintEndFrameBanner = true;
    }
  }

  static void logFrameStats() {
    // Implementation for frame statistics logging
  }

  static void checkMemoryUsage() {
    // Implementation for memory usage monitoring
  }
}

Update the existing pubspec.yaml to include new dependencies:

yamlCopydependencies:
  # Add these to existing dependencies

Git Commands for Committing Changes

Here are the common commands you'll use to commit your changes to GitHub:

Stage Your Changes:

git add .    # Stages all changes
# OR
git add <file1> <file2> ... # Stages specific files
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash

git add . stages all the changes you have in your working directory, including new, modified or deleted files. Use git add <file1> <file2> to stage specific files.

Commit Your Changes:

git commit -m "Your commit message here"
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash

git commit creates a new commit with the changes you have staged before.

The -m flag allows you to write the commit message inline.

It's very important to have a meaningful commit message for each commit, so it is easier to follow the changes later.

Example Commit Message Styles:

fix: Fixes the issue when .... - Use this when fixing a bug or an issue in your code.

feat: Added new map loading feature - Use this when adding a new functionality to your application.

refactor: Code cleanup and performance improvements - Use this when cleaning up the code without adding new functionality.

docs: Updated documentation and readme file - Use this when modifying documents like README.md.

Push Your Commit to GitHub:

git push origin <your-branch-name>
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash

git push uploads your changes to the remote repository.

origin is the default remote name for the repository you cloned.

<your-branch-name> is the branch you are working on.

Example Workflow

Make Changes: Modify your code.

Stage Changes: git add .

Commit: git commit -m "fix: Corrected the issue with map bounds."

Push: git push origin main (or your branch name).

GitHub Workflow Summary

Fork the Repository: On GitHub, click the "Fork" button to create a copy of the repository on your account.

Clone the Fork: Clone your fork to your local machine: git clone <your-fork-url>

Create a Branch: Create a new branch to work on your feature or bug fix: git checkout -b <your-branch-name>

Make Changes: Write your code.

Stage Your Changes: git add .

Commit: git commit -m "feat: Implement map region download feature"

Push: git push origin <your-branch-name>

Create Pull Request: On GitHub, create a pull request from your branch to the main branch.

Code Review: Other collaborators review your changes, you can also request that yourself.

Merge: If approved, your pull request will be merged.

Important Tips

.gitignore: Make sure you have a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files such as logs or local files.

Branching: Use feature branches to separate development efforts.

i choose mapbox because it handle offline better than google
riverpod is the best state manageent there fro flutter
all kind of markers, to use, and i must get them from an api
just start giving me what to do exaclt and all file code plus test

can you do a full code review on th eproject and if it does what it should
don't write any code, just like files, and if i followed all good appraches for 2024 and if i did th asignement as it should


Reducing Frame Drops:

Annotation: We are already rendering the annotations by batch, so that should be good.

Reduce map complexity: Use a simple map style, with less details.

Caching: Implement more caching logic if you are still having performance problems.




1. I/Choreographer: Skipped ... frames! The application may be doing too much work on its main thread. (Again)

This message persists, and it's often related to heavy computations on the main thread. We already covered this in the previous response.

Recommendation:

Profile your app again using Flutter DevTools to identify the bottlenecks.

Focus on offloading heavy tasks to background threads using compute or Isolate. This includes:

Image processing.

File operations.

Any intensive data processing.

JSON parsing

2. E/ThemeUtils: View class ... is an AppCompat widget that can only be used with a Theme.AppCompat theme (or descendant). (Again)

This error persists even after we try to solve it in the last response, is not critical and does not affect the application.

Recommendation:

Add Theme.of(context).copyWith() to all theme data.

Check that you are using the latest version of the Mapbox SDK and flutter plugins.

Check that you are using the correct dependencies in your pubspec.yaml.

3. There are multiple heroes that share the same tag within a subtree. (Again)

This error persists, we said that you were not using heroes in the last response, but you actually are.

Problem: This means you have multiple FloatingActionButton widgets within the same route (subtree) without a unique tag.

Solution:

If you are using the default FloatingActionButton, it has a default tag that is not unique. Provide a unique heroTag for each FloatingActionButton within a route. In our case, this is happening with the map controls.


This log might be due to using the WillPopScope widget. You can ignore it, or implement a better navigation handling.


Performance logs:

Solution: Profile your app using the Flutter DevTools to analyze these performance bottlenecks, that might be a problem with your device.

Solution: Move all your image processing, json parsing, and heavy calculations to the background using compute or Isolate.

Solution: Use ListView.builder instead of ListView

Solution: Add const in the constructors where possible.

Solution: Separate your widgets in different files, this may help with performance, and code readability.

WindowOnBackDispatcher

Solution: You can ignore this error, or check your code and implement a better navigation handling.

WindowOnBackDispatcher:
zzz
Action: You can safely ignore this warning, or try to fix the navigation handling in your app

Performance Bottlenecks:

Action: Profile your app using Flutter DevTools to pinpoint the specific operations causing the performance issue. Use the profiler to check the CPU, memory and the timeline to see exactly what is causing the lag.

Action: Move all your heavy calculations, and image processing to the background, by using compute and Isolate.

Action: Use ListView.builder for long lists.

Action: Separate your widgets into different files.

Action: Add const in the constructors where possible.
* Action: Analyze all the performance metrics and refactor the app where it is needed.


lib/shared/widgets/loading_overlay.dart

Good: Simple but reusable loading overlay widget.

Good: Center a progress indicator with a message below.

Potential Improvement: Could add a cancel functionality.

Test files:

Good: All service layers, viewmodels and some widgets have their own test files.

Good: The tests are well defined and use the correct mocking library and methods.

Potential Improvement: Some methods from the services don't have their tests, especially the exception scenarios.

Potential Improvement: It would be good to test more scenarios for MapScreen, such as navigation and map interactions.

Potential Improvement: It would be good to create tests for the helpers.

Potential Improvement: It would be good to test the integrations with the Mapbox SDK to make sure all methods works fine.







I'll combine all the platform-specific modifications into a comprehensive guide. Here's a consolidated version:

# Complete Guide to Platform-Specific Modifications for Flutter Projects

## General Principles

- Prioritize Flutter packages and Dart implementations over native code
- Use platform channels for Flutter-native communication when necessary
- Maintain clean configuration files for essential settings only
- Always check plugin documentation for specific requirements
- Perform clean builds after modifications
- Test thoroughly on both platforms
- Ensure dependency compatibility

    <array>
        <string>remote-notification</string>
    </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### AppDelegate Configuration

For Swift (AppDelegate.swift):
```swift
import UIKit
import Flutter
import flutter_local_notifications

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
    override func application(
        _ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
    ) -> Bool {
        FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.setPluginRegistrantCallback { (registry) in
            GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: registry)
        }
        return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
    }
}
```

For Objective-C (AppDelegate.m):
```objectivec
#import <FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin.h>

void registerPlugins(NSObject<FlutterPluginRegistry>* registry) {
    [GeneratedPluginRegistrant registerWithRegistry:registry];
}

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application 
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [GeneratedPluginRegistrant registerWithRegistry:self];
    [FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin setPluginRegistrantCallback:registerPlugins];
    return [super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Make necessary changes to the platform-specific files
2. Run `flutter pub get` for Android Gradle sync
3. Execute `pod install` in the iOS directory
4. Perform `flutter clean` followed by `flutter run`
5. Test thoroughly on both platforms

Remember to always consult the official documentation for any plugins you're using, as they may have additional platform-specific requirements.

Before you proceed to use these configurations, I'd recommend that you go through this checklist:

Verify Plugin Docs: Double-check the documentation of mapbox_maps_flutter, geolocator, flutter_local_notifications, and any other plugins you're using to ensure that you haven't missed any specific setup steps.

Keystore: Make sure that you have added a keystore path and a correct signing password to the build.gradle.

iOS Bundle ID: Make sure that the bundle id is correct and unique in the general settings of the Xcode project.

Permissions: Ensure all permissions you need are requested and handled.

Clean Build: Always do a clean build after any native changes to avoid unexpected behaviors.

Testing: Test thoroughly in real devices and on emulators/simulators to avoid any runtime errors.

Flutter Doctor: Run flutter doctor to make sure that you have all dependencies installed.

Requirements 
The Maps Flutter SDK is compatible with applications:

Deployed on iOS 12 or higher
Built using the Android SDK 21 or higher
Built using the Flutter SDK 3.22.3/Dart SDK 3.4.4 or higher
Installation 
Configure credentials 
To run the Maps Flutter SDK you will need to configure the Mapbox Access Token. Read more about access tokens in the platform Android or iOS docs.

Access token
You can set the access token for Mapbox Maps Flutter SDK(as well as for every Mapbox SDK) via MapboxOptions:

  MapboxOptions.setAccessToken(ACCESS_TOKEN);
It's a good practice to retrieve the access token from some external source.

You can pass access token via the command line arguments when either building :

flutter build <platform> --dart-define ACCESS_TOKEN=...
or running the application :

flutter run --dart-define ACCESS_TOKEN=...
You can also persist token in launch.json :

"configurations": [
    {
        ...
        "args": [
            "--dart-define", "ACCESS_TOKEN=..."
        ],
    }
]
Then to retrieve the token from the environment in the application :

String ACCESS_TOKEN = String.fromEnvironment("ACCESS_TOKEN");
Add the dependency 
To use the Maps Flutter SDK add the git dependency to the pubspec.yaml:

dependencies:
  mapbox_maps_flutter: ^2.5.0
Configure permissions 
You will need to grant location permission in order to use the location component of the Maps Flutter SDK.

You can use an existing library to request location permission, e.g. with permission_handler await Permission.locationWhenInUse.request(); will trigger permission request.

You also need to declare the permission for both platforms :

Android
Add the following permissions to the manifest:

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
iOS
Add the following key/value pair to the Runner/Info.plist. In the value field, explain why you need access to location:

    <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
    <string>[Your explanation here]</string>
Add a map 
Import mapbox_maps_flutter library and add a simple map:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:mapbox_maps_flutter/mapbox_maps_flutter.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(home: MapWidget()));
}
MapWidget widget
The MapWidget widget provides options to customize the map - you can set MapOptions, CameraOptions, styleURL, etc.

You can also add listeners for various events related to style loading, map rendering, map loading.

MapboxMap controller
The MapboxMap controller instance is provided with MapWidget.onMapCreated callback.

MapboxMap exposes an entry point to the most of the APIs Maps Flutter SDK provides. It allows to control the map, camera, styles, observe map events, query rendered features, etc.

It's organized similarly to the Android and iOS counterparts.

To interact with the map after it's created store the MapboxMap object somewhere :

class FullMap extends StatefulWidget {
  const FullMap();

  @override
  State createState() => FullMapState();
}

class FullMapState extends State<FullMap> {
  MapboxMap? mapboxMap;

  _onMapCreated(MapboxMap mapboxMap) {
    this.mapboxMap = mapboxMap;
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new Scaffold(
        body: MapWidget(
      key: ValueKey("mapWidget"),
      onMapCreated: _onMapCreated,
    ));
  }
}
User location 
To observe the user's location and show the location indicator on the map use LocationComponentSettingsInterface accessible via MapboxMap.location.

For more information, please see the User Location guides in our Flutter, Android, and iOS documentation.

You need to grant location permission prior to using location component (as explained before).

Location puck 
To customize the appearance of the location puck call MapboxMap.location.updateSettings method.

To use the 3D puck with model downloaded from Uri instead of the default 2D puck:

  mapboxMap.location.updateSettings(LocationComponentSettings(
      locationPuck: LocationPuck(
          locationPuck3D: LocationPuck3D(
              modelUri:
                  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/master/2.0/Duck/glTF-Embedded/Duck.gltf",))));
You can find more examples of customization in the sample app.

Markers and annotations 
Additional information is available in our Flutter, Android, and iOS documentation.

You have several options to add annotations on the map.

Use the AnnotationManager APIs to create circle, point, polygon, and polyline annotations.
To create 5 point annotations using custom icon:

  mapboxMap.annotations.createPointAnnotationManager().then((pointAnnotationManager) async {
    final ByteData bytes =
        await rootBundle.load('assets/symbols/custom-icon.png');
    final Uint8List list = bytes.buffer.asUint8List();
    var options = <PointAnnotationOptions>[];
    for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      options.add(PointAnnotationOptions(
          geometry: createRandomPoint().toJson(), image: list));
    }
    pointAnnotationManager?.createMulti(options);
  });
You can find more examples of the AnnotationManagers usage in the sample app : point annotations, circle annotations, polygon annotations, polyline annotations.

Use style layers. This will require writing more code but is more flexible and provides better performance for the large amount of annotations (e.g. hundreds and thousands of them). More about adding style layers in the Map styles section.
Map styles 
Additional information is available in our Flutter, Android, and iOS documentation.

The Mapbox Maps Flutter SDK allows full customization of the look of the map used in your application.

Set a style 
You can specify the initial style uri at MapWidget.styleUri, or load it at runtime using MapboxMap.loadStyleURI / MapboxMap.loadStyleJson:

mapboxMap.loadStyleURI(Styles.LIGHT);
Work with layers 
You can familiarize with the concept of sources, layers and their supported types in the documentation for Flutter, iOS, and Android.

To add, remove or change a source or a layer, use the MapboxMap.style object.

To add a GeoJsonSource and a LineLayer using the source :

  var data = await rootBundle.loadString('assets/polyline.geojson');
  await mapboxMap.style.addSource(GeoJsonSource(id: "line", data: data));
  await mapboxMap.style.addLayer(LineLayer(
      id: "line_layer",
      sourceId: "line",
      lineJoin: LineJoin.ROUND,
      lineCap: LineCap.ROUND,
      lineOpacity: 0.7,
      lineColor: Colors.red.value,
      lineWidth: 8.0));
Using expressions 
You can change the appearance of a layer based on properties in the layer's data source or zoom level. Refer to the documentation for the description of supported expressions. You can also learn more in the documentation for Flutter, iOS, and Android.

To apply an expression to interpolate gradient color to a line layer:

  mapboxMap.style.setStyleLayerProperty("layer", "line-gradient",
      '["interpolate",["linear"],["line-progress"],0.0,["rgb",6,1,255],0.5,["rgb",0,255,42],0.7,["rgb",255,252,0],1.0,["rgb",255,30,0]]');
Camera and animations 
Platform docs: Android, iOS.

The camera is the user's viewpoint above the map. The Maps Flutter SDK provides you with options to set and adjust the camera position, listen for camera changes, get the camera position, and restrict the camera position to set bounds.

Camera position 
You can set the starting camera position using MapWidget.cameraOptions:

MapWidget(
  key: ValueKey("mapWidget"),
  cameraOptions: CameraOptions(
      center: Point(coordinates: Position(-80.1263, 25.7845)).toJson(),
      zoom: 12.0),
));
or update it at runtime using MapboxMap.setCamera :

MapboxMap.setCamera(CameraOptions(
  center: Point(coordinates: Position(-80.1263, 25.7845)).toJson(),
  zoom: 12.0));
You can find more examples of interaction with the camera in the sample app.

Camera animations 
Camera animations are the means by which camera settings are changed from old values to new values over a period of time. You can animate the camera using flyTo or easeTo and move to a new center location, update the bearing, pitch, zoom, padding, and anchor.

To start a flyTo animation to the specific camera options :

  mapboxMap?.flyTo(
    CameraOptions(
        anchor: ScreenCoordinate(x: 0, y: 0),
        zoom: 17,
        bearing: 180,
        pitch: 30),
    MapAnimationOptions(duration: 2000, startDelay: 0));
You can find more examples of animations in the sample app.

User interaction 
Platform docs: Android, iOS.

Users interacting with the map in your application can explore the map by performing standard gestures.

You can retrieve or update the GestureSettings using MapboxMap.gestures.

You can observe gesture events using MapWidget.onTapListener, MapWidget.onLongTapListener, MapWidget.onScrollListener.

pub package

This package contains a recommended set of lints for Flutter apps, packages, and plugins to encourage good coding practices.

This package is built on top of Dart's recommended.yaml set of lints from package:lints.

Lints are surfaced by the dart analyzer, which statically checks dart code. Dart-enabled IDEs typically present the issues identified by the analyzer in their UI. Alternatively, the analyzer can be invoked manually by running flutter analyze.


analysis_options.yaml

flutter pub add dev:flutter_lint



Okay, let's break down a practical workflow for how to address the linting issues in your Flutter project, step-by-step. This will involve using your IDE, the flutter analyze command, and a methodical approach.

Workflow for Addressing Lint Issues

Set Up Your IDE

IDE Configuration: Make sure you have a Flutter-compatible IDE (like VS Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA) with all the relevant plugins (like Dart and Flutter plugins).

Enable Lints: Your IDE should automatically detect and display the lint issues based on your analysis_options.yaml file. Make sure that the integration between Flutter and the linter is enabled.

Enable Auto-Fix: Most IDEs also have auto-fix features for lint issues (where the IDE will fix some of the errors by itself), use this if you want.

Prioritize Errors and Warnings

Start with Errors:

Look at your terminal output of flutter analyze.

Focus on the errors first. These are the ones that have the tag error in the output.

Fix these problems, since they are the more critical ones.

Address Warnings:

Focus on the warnings next. These are marked as warning in the output.

Fix all the warnings. These are often related to plugin setup or issues in code structure.

Address Errors First: These should be the priority, and you can start fixing the error level issues in the list.

Fixing Issues "As You Go"

Focus on One Issue at a Time: Don't try to fix everything at once. Instead, focus on one lint rule or a few related ones at a time.

Use Your IDE's Suggestions: If you can, use the quick fixes, auto-fixes, and suggestions that your IDE provides for these issues.

Re-analyze: After you've made some changes, re-run flutter analyze to check if the problems you fixed are indeed fixed and to make sure that you haven't introduced any new ones.

Address Style Issues Gradually

Incremental Approach: Don't make all style changes at once. Choose a few rules (e.g., prefer_single_quotes, avoid_print), and try to make those changes in the codebase first.

Code by Section: Instead of doing all the changes on all files, choose a file, a folder or a small section of your project to start fixing, and then move to the others.

Focus on Consistency: The most important thing is to be consistent, avoid using double quotes sometimes and single quotes other times.

Apply One Best Practice At a Time: Avoid trying to change all code issues at the same time, that might introduce new problems and errors.

Prioritize: Start with code that you use more often and try to clean that.

Utilize IDE Features

View Problems: Use your IDE's "Problems" panel or similar to view all the errors and warnings. This panel usually will show you the file, line number, and a description of the lint error.

Use Code Actions: Most IDEs offer "code actions" (or quick fixes) for common issues. Try Alt + Enter to see them, and apply those actions to fix simple problems quickly.

Auto-formatting: Run the formatter for every change to keep the code clear.

Adopt the Changes

Apply the Best Practices: Try to adhere to the best practices that the linting is recommending. Try to understand why they are being applied and how will that help the project.

Learn why: Every time you address an error, warning or info, you should try to understand why the linter is recommending the change.

Don't disable unless needed: If a rule is not working for you or for your code, you can disable it, but only if you have a good reason for that, and should add a comment to explain why.

Code Style

Consistency is Key: When changing, follow a style standard, that way you avoid having a code style that mixes different styling rules.

Use the Format Command Often: Every time you do some changes, use dart format to format your project to apply the styling choices, so it is easier to see where you still have to change code and the styling inconsistencies.

Analyze Often

Regular Checks: Run flutter analyze frequently (e.g., after each significant code change) to make sure you are on top of the project issues, and fix them quickly before they multiply.

CI/CD Integration: If you are using a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment service, add a check step for flutter analyze.

Example Workflow

Open Your IDE: Open your Flutter project in VS Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ.

Check Problems: Look at the "Problems" panel in the IDE.

Choose a Lint Rule: Select avoid_print or always_specify_types to focus on first.

Start Fixing:

Go to a file with lint issues.

Look for print statements and remove them (or replace them with a logging solution).

Look for variables that are missing the type, and add it to the definition.

Re-run flutter analyze after making these changes.

Check if the issue is still there, and if not, then move on to the next rule.

Continue: Go through files one by one, fixing the selected lint issue, or a selected set of lint issues, and then you start to analyze again.

Re-analyze: Once you have fixed the issues, you analyze and then chose other linting rule that you would like to address.

Key Takeaways

Incremental Approach: Make the changes in small iterations to avoid adding new errors or issues.

Consistency and Readability: Consistency is key for readable code.

IDE is Important: Take advantage of your IDE's features for fixing lint issues, since those features will increase your productivity.

Keep Checking Often: Make running flutter analyze a frequent part of your workflow.

By following this step-by-step guide and making full use of your IDE's features you can resolve your project's lint issues effectively. Let me know if you have any further questions or want to dive into specific lint rules.
